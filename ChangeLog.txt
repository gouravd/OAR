matched words in Subject, in body and displaying in the Message prompt itself.
Removed a known glitch (refreshed by http://oar.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=51311): Now
empty lines are not treated as words
Removed the following Line from the Help Menu (Most importantly you need to ensure that you press Enter once after the last word.)
Due to version change, filenames changes too.
Changed the Name of helpXXXX.txt to OARhelpxxxx.txt
After digging into the error reported by http://oar.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=1456, found that if
we have outlook running in Background(without an Outlook window), the Application.ActiveExplorer() returns null. The Outlook has to start with a Window(not as background process) and the Menu would load. If
before the menu is loaded the the Outlook starts as background process, now it prompts user to close the Outlook and start 
normally. I might consider removing this prompt completely in future versions, because the code changes allows things to work normally and hence this prompt woudl be only informational.
