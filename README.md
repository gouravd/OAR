Outlook Attachment Reminder Suite 1.0 Release Candidate - For Outlook 2007/2010/2013 CP
=========
First of all I would like to thank users whose suggestions have helped me improve this Addin. But as usual, I would continue to request for more feature request/feedback. I am waiting to hear about new feature requests. You can directly contact me through the contact form.
What does this do?

How often have you sent an email, probably willing to send an attachment as well mentioning about it and after 5 minutes you get a reply saying there is no attachment attached!!

This project is to make sure you do not go through this " self humiliation" often. Outlook Attachment Reminder is built to help you achieve this and much much more.

So lets contribute and make this a great and effective addin. I am eagerly waiting for feature requests and bugs :). I have had lot of great requests and some nasty bugs reported. Please keep them coming..
